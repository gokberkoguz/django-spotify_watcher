Removed test-production due to the successfull proof of concept. Lots of messy code though due to the trials and adding new features. 

Currently-

Modal structure for spotify almost finished.
Lyrics feature tested.

Next-

Search and save algorithm to get the big data of tracks etc. from spotify
Rest endpoints,serializers to start UI design
Javascripts for dynamic design
